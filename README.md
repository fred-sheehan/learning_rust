# learning_rust

This is my learning journey in the Rust programming Language, and I aim to complete some projects for fun, that will help me cement my knowledge of the core concepts of rust. I've been doing some developing on my own machine, and thought I'd share my coding journey. Hopefully, this code may prove useful for others, or they may just like the programmes I write. Some of it in the beginning, will simply be me going through the 'Rust Programming Book', although I aim to do some more interesting projects as well.

## Don't forget..

When programming in Rust, learn to love the extremely opinionated compiler!
It may seem like it's being a bit of a pain, but it's actually helping you to write better code. It's a bit like having a very strict teacher, who is actually trying to help you learn, even if it doesn't feel like it at the time.

Most people will start learning coding with Python, a much easier language to start with. Very forgiving, as it hides some of the more difficult concepts behind its declarative nature. Python is a great langauage, and has a huge following in the AI or scientific space, but if you want to get, 'close to the metal', you'll need to learn a language like Rust, C or C++.

I used to spend hours in a debugger reading machine code, so the concepts of how the hardware works, and why I might choose the fast stack memory, as opposed to the slower heap memory, are not new to me.

## So, why Rust?

Low enough to the hardware to be interesting, safe enough that I can, with the help of the very strict compiler, actually make decent progress. It's high enough level in its abstractions to save me from having to manually do everything, and if your code compiles, it should be correct.
(I guess after x86_64 assembly language, anything is going to seem high level!)

Rust has now reached a decent stage of maturity in many ways, it's even being written in to the Linux kernel, and gaining use in many large Software organisations. The power and speed of C and C++, with the safety of a language like Python.
