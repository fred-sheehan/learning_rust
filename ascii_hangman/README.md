# An Ascii art Hangman game Written in rust.

This is a simple hangman game that can be played in the terminal.
The source code text (main.rs in the src folder) has been heavily
commented to help anyone who is new to rust understand the code.

It uses the `rand` crate to generate random words from a list of words
and the std library to handle user input and output.
If you want to know the details of how the game works, you can read the
source code and the extensive comments.

I have also included an optimised binary file in this root directory
called `Ascii_Hangman` which can be run directly from the terminal.
